## Installation

Simply clone the source code from this repository and apply the following environment configuration: 

### Environment Configration
* Python: 2.7

* Android SDK:
    API 19

* Linux:
    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev

* Mac OS:
    brew install coreutils for gtimeout

Install Python dependencies:

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
    python main.py <apk_path | source_folder_path>

where apk\_path is path to the subject apk under test  
or you can specify source\_folder\_path for the subject app with source code

### Subject Requirement:
* instrumented apk should be compiled and named with suffix "-debug.apk"
* closed-source/non-instrumented apk name should end with ".apk" 

### Settings
* ANDROID\_HOME and WORKING\_DIR in [settings.py](https://github.com/Rhapsod/sapienz/blob/master/settings.py) should be set before starting Sapeinz.

### Output
* for open-sourced apps, outputs are stored under the given source folder
* for closed-sourced apps, output are stored under <apk_file_path>_output

Output content:

    /coverages - Coverage reports are stored here
    
    /crashes - Crash reports and corresponding test cases that lead to the crashes 
    (and also recorded videos files when using real devices)
    
    /intermediate - Generated test event sequences for each generation; logbook of the genetic evolution; 
    and line charts showing the variation trend for each objectives.


##  Notes
* This implementation has been tested with Android 4.4, running on Ubuntu 14.04 and Mac OS 10.10
* If measure statement coverage for open-sourced apps, the subjects need to be processed to support EMMA instrumentation:
(Please refer to Dynodroid https://code.google.com/archive/p/dyno-droid/)
* This version is ready for emulators. 
It also supports real devices, you may need to adapt related code for your specific devices.
